# react-props
Assignment that demonstrates knowledge of React and how to use props. The layout of the live page is very basic and uninteresting as I did not pay much attention to how it looked but I managed to create several props for cards. This assignment was fun and I'm starting to really like using React. As in the assignment before this one, I had a bit of trouble uploading the files correctly to GitHub but managed to do it eventually.
